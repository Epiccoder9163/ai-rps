# AI-RPS
 A very basic AI based rock paper scissors game
Uses any LLM of your choice, but I have found that qwen3:0.6b works the best.

## Requirements
A desktop computer
Ollama installed and running
Python 3
## How to install
Clone the repository

create a venv environment (python3 -m venv venv)
Activate the venv environment (source venv/bin/activate)
Install the prerequisites (pip install -r requirements.txt)
Run the script (python3 ./rockpaperscissors.py)
